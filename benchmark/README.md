# bluetape4k-leader benchmark

[한국어](./README.ko.md) | English

This non-published module contains comparable `kotlinx-benchmark` suites for
the leader election backends. The JVM runner is JMH, and the benchmark source
set lives under `benchmark/src/benchmark/kotlin`.

Use these results for same-machine before/after comparisons. They are not
release-grade performance claims.

## Benchmark Command

```bash
./gradlew :benchmark:benchmarkBenchmark :benchmark:benchmarkAverageTimeBenchmark --no-configuration-cache --rerun-tasks
```

The 2026-05-21 baseline was collected with one fork, one thread, two warmup
iterations, and three one-second measurement iterations. Full environment and
caveats are recorded in
[`docs/benchmarks/2026-05-21-leader-cross-backend-baseline.md`](../docs/benchmarks/2026-05-21-leader-cross-backend-baseline.md).

## Charts

Remote backend charts exclude the local and H2 rows so the distributed backend
differences remain visible.

## Cross-Backend Results

Higher is better for throughput. Lower is better for average time.

## Interpretation

- Treat throughput as the canonical ranking metric; average time is auxiliary.
- Compare distributed backends against distributed backends. Do not rank local
  H2 rows against Redis, Hazelcast, ZooKeeper, or MongoDB as distributed systems.
- The local rows isolate framework and API overhead before any network or
  storage round trip.
- Benchmark setup performs a smoke `runIfLeader` check before measurement, so a
  failed infrastructure connection does not become a false fast-path row.
- Repeat noisy rows, especially suspend MongoDB, before optimizing against them.

## Benchmark Classes

| Class | Scenario |

| `BackendLeaderElectorBenchmark` | Blocking `runIfLeader` across local, Redis, Exposed JDBC H2, MongoDB, Hazelcast, and ZooKeeper |
| `SuspendBackendLeaderElectorBenchmark` | Suspend `runIfLeader` across local, Redis, Exposed R2DBC H2, MongoDB, Hazelcast, and ZooKeeper |
| `LocalLeaderElectorBenchmark` | Local blocking, async, completable-future, suspend, and virtual-thread elector overhead |
| `HistoryRecorderBenchmark` | No-op and in-memory leader history recorder overhead |
